# Azimuth

Azimuth is a turn-based 3D artillery game. In the spirit of classic artillery games, players
choose a weapon, aim with azimuth, elevation, and power, fire, observe the result, and adjust for
the next shot. Terrain and environmental conditions will make those choices interesting.

The game values fun and learnable, internally consistent behaviour over real-world simulation
fidelity. Ridiculous weapons and strange battlefields are welcome when they make the game better.

## Status

First impact-feedback loop. Azimuth renders two distinct, terrain-grounded tank placeholders on a
bounded non-flat battlefield and can fire one visible deterministic development projectile through
a configurable gravity field. A projectile stops at the visible terrain surface, leaves a simple
development impact marker, and triggers a brief expanding visual boom at the simulation-resolved
impact position. The boom is presentation only: it causes no damage or terrain change. Azimuth
still has no gameplay explosion, terrain deformation, aiming UI, movement, turns, audio content,
or networking.

## Prerequisites

Use the current stable Rust toolchain. `rust-toolchain.toml` records this policy and requests the
standard `rustfmt` and Clippy components. Nightly Rust and unstable features are not required.

## Build, Run, and Validate

Run commands from the repository root:

```sh
# Fast workspace compilation check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets

# Full workspace build
cargo build --workspace

# Run the minimal 3D battlefield
cargo run --package azimuth-game

# Complete workspace test suite
cargo test --workspace

# Verify formatting
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Lint every workspace target and fail on warnings
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

## Development Workflow

Create and switch to a dedicated feature branch before writing a feature specification. Keep the
specification, planning, implementation, and feature-specific documentation on that branch until
the feature is integrated. Keep scope bounded, and update fulfilled roadmap items only after their
acceptance criteria are met.

The long-lived backlog is [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). Feature specifications live beneath
[docs/specs/](docs/specs/) in directories named `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-feature-name` using the local
development time. Read the active specification and its plan before implementing work.

Use readable standard Rust unit tests by default. When simulation work arrives, prefer
deterministic, reproducible inputs and explicitly control randomness. Add readable regression tests
for meaningful gameplay bugs where practical; introduce integration-test support only when a real
external interface warrants it.

## Battlefield Controls

The current camera is a development inspection tool, not the final gameplay camera:

- Hold the right mouse button and drag to orbit the battlefield.
- Scroll the mouse wheel to move closer to or farther from it.
- Use WASD or arrow keys to pan across the battlefield.
- Press Space to fire one fixed development shot from Player One. Further presses are ignored until
  that projectile impacts terrain or leaves its simulation volume. A small orange marker shows the
  latest terrain-impact position and clears when the next shot launches. A bright temporary boom
  expands from that same authoritative position; its disappearance does not remove the marker.
- Press I to fire a shorter fixed development impact shot. It is an inspection aid that lands
  within the current battlefield; it is not an aiming control.

World-space and shot-angle conventions are documented in
[docs/world-conventions.md](docs/world-conventions.md). The fixed-step ballistic model and its
development defaults are documented in [docs/projectile-model.md](docs/projectile-model.md).

## Automation

Continuous integration has been evaluated and deliberately deferred. The direct local commands
above provide the current repository-health checks; CI will be reconsidered when hosting or
collaboration needs establish a concrete benefit.

## Workspace Layout

`crates/azimuth-game` is the initial game application member. The repository root holds workspace
and project metadata. Future sibling crates, such as `azimuth-math` or a physics crate, will be
introduced only when a concrete dependency, testability, reuse, or ownership boundary justifies
them.

See [the rendering technology decision](docs/adr/0001-initial-rendering-technology.md) for the Bevy rationale and
its trade-offs.
